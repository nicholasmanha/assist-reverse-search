THIS MAJOR IS OFFERED BY THE COLLEGE OF LETTERS AND SCIENCE (L&S).              
By the end of the spring term preceding fall enrollment at Berkeley, you must complete:                                                           
1) The L&S Requirements in Reading & Composition, Quantitative Reasoning, and Foreign Language; OR
2) IGETC                                                                 
Major Requirements:                                                     
Complete as many lower division major requirements as possible.  See details on preparation for this major below.
Primary selection criteria for admission, in general:                   
- completion of L&S Requirements (or IGETC), plus                              
- strength of academic preparation, and                                        
- grade point average.

Advice regarding courses in computer science:                            
The Computer Science department at Berkeley recognizes the fact that courses comparable to Berkeley's Computer Science 61A-61B-
61C series are difficult to find at most community colleges. With few exceptions, transfer students must take COMPSCI 61A during 
their first semester at Berkeley.                        
To be competitive for admission purposes, the department advises prospective transfer students to take UC-transferable courses in:        
1) All equivalent Mathematics prerequisites:  Math 1A, Math 1B, and Math 54.  
2) Data structures--even if not officially comparable to Berkeley's COMPSCI 61B; and
3) Java (preferred) or C++.           
The entire Computer Science 61 series is also offered during the Berkeley Summer session.  The department recommends that, when 
possible, students take one of these courses during the summer session prior to transfer.
If admitted, transfer students must achieve a 3.30 cumulative GPA in those remaining prerequisite courses (CS 61A, CS 61B, and CS 70) 
taken at UC Berkeley in order to petition for admission to the major.
COMPSCI 61B
Any course/s approved as comparable to COMPSCI 61B must include coverage of object-oriented programming, hashing, heaps, priority 
queues and graphs, together with at least one programming assignment of 1000 or more lines of code. If any of these topics are 
missing, the missing material may be acquired by taking a bridge course, COMPSCI 47B, at Berkeley. If you see "Articulation 
subject to completion of a university course'" below the community college course, then in addition to completing the community 
college course, you must complete COMPSCI 47B after enrollment at UC Berkeley. 
COMPSCI 70
COMPSCI 70 is offered during the Berkeley Summer session or Concurrent Enrollment. 
RECOMMENDED
Math 53 is not required for the major. Completion of a Math 53 equivalent would waive 3 units of upper-division tech electives for the 
major. 
SERIES/SEQUENCE ARTICULATION
Unless the course equivalents are separately specified, do not assume that a sequence can be divided. If a series of courses at a 
community college is required (e.g., English 1A + 1B + 1C = English R1A and R1B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and 
must be completed at the same community college in order to ensure that you have satisfied the requirement.
