# Assist.org Reverse Search

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What this solves

In community college, I often needed transfer courses that were not available locally. This software lets you reverse search assist.org by entering a course, and it shows all California colleges offering that course. 

## Built With

* Python
* Assist.org API

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## How to use
Link to Assist: https://assist.org/
Here is a basic command example
```bash
python main.py --university="University of California, Berkeley" --major="Computer Science, Lower Division B.A." --course="MATH 54"
```
Each argument needs to be copied from the assist website. The above example was from 2021-2022.
